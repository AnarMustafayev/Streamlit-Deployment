This repository contains code for a data science project that focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and modeling of two datasets (loan_pred.csv and water_potability.csv) using the Streamlit library. Various techniques for visualization and modeling are employed to gain insights and build predictive models. This project shows how to deploy a ML model using Streamlit library in Python.
## Exploratory Data Analysis

The initial data exploration stage provides insights into the characteristics of the datasets. Key visualizations and statistical summaries are used to understand the distribution of features, identify patterns, and detect outliers.

## Modeling

Various machine learning models (Xgbboost and Catboost) are trained and evaluated on each dataset, and the results are analyzed for predictive performance.
